    <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>

    <p>Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box.
        Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):</p>

        You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property
        specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
